# yandex-practicum--ML--predicting-gold-amount-recovered-from-gold-ore
In this project, we need to build a model that will predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

The libraries that were been used in this project are as follows:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. numpy.random (RandomState)
4. sidetable
5. seaborn
6. matplotlib
7. sklearn.linear_model (LinearRegression , Lasso)
8. sklearn.neighbors (KNeighborsRegressor)
9. sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeRegressor)
10. sklearn.ensemble (RandomForestRegressor)
11. sklearn.model_selection (GridSearchCV)
12. sklearn.metrics (make_scorer, mean_absolute_error)
13. sklearn.impute (KNNImputer)
14. sklearn.preprocessing (MinMaxScaler)
15. warnings
